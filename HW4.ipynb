    "1. **Difference Between SEM and Standard Deviation**: You asked about the difference between the \"standard error of the mean\" (SEM) and the \"standard deviation\" of the original data, and what distinct ideas each captures.\n",

    "2. **Using SEM for Confidence Intervals**: You inquired about how to use the SEM to create a 95% confidence interval that covers 95% of the bootstrapped sample means.\n",

    "3. **Formulas for CI and SEM in Jupyter Notebook Markdown**: You requested the formulas for Confidence Interval (CI) and Standard Error of the Mean (SEM) formatted for Jupyter Notebook markdown.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Bootstrapped Confidence Interval without SEM**: You asked how to create a 95% bootstrapped confidence interval using bootstrapped means without relying on the standard error of the mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Code for 95% Bootstrap Confidence Interval**: You requested code to produce a 95% bootstrap confidence interval for a population mean based on a sample, along with comments to demonstrate how to adapt it for different population parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Explanation of np.array**: You asked about the purpose and functionality of `np.array`.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Distinguishing Population Parameter and Sample Statistic**: You inquired about why it is important to differentiate between the population parameter and the sample statistic when discussing confidence intervals.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Vaccine Effectiveness Analysis**: Finally, you provided a dataset and asked for an analysis to determine whether the vaccine is effective, including the necessary statistical procedures.\n",
